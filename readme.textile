h1. Flickr Backup

A script to backup my Flickr photos locally, with an eye towards importing it in to another system (like iPhoto) later.

It cares about:

* Getting a single high quality image
* Storing metadata, particuarly title, tags, geo
* Keeping the local data simple, browsable and no crazy formats

It doesn't care about:

* Comments or favourites
* Being user friendly

h2. Version One

Would ideally be able to:

* Grab the most recent N photos
* Include title in file name
* Use file system folders for sets
