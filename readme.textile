h1. Flickr Archive

A tool to archive Flickr photos and metadata for a single user.

It cares about:

* Getting original photos out of Flickr
* Along with meta data like titles, tags, geo, 

It doesn't care about:

* Comments or favourites
* Being user friendly

h2. Flickr ABCs

This is one of a planned set of three tools around exported flickr data.

* A) "Flickr Archive":https://github.com/dsingleton/flickr-archive - Extracts photos and metadata from Flickr in to an archive, for use by other tools
* B) "Flickr Browser":https://github.com/dsingleton/flickr-browser - A web-app to browse the photos and metadata of a Flickr Archive
* C) Flickr Something-begining-with-C - A tool to view a Flickr Archive in a regular file system, where the photos themselves contain the metadata
